# Making the most of fortnightly 1-1 meetings

Most lab members have 1-1 meetings with Edward, fortnightly.
This page describes guidelines for how to structure those meetings so that they are pleasant and productive.

Project students will find these guidelines useful to make the most of their meetings with Edward and any co-supervisors, although the meetingsmay have a different frequency or format.
