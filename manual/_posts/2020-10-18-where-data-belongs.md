# Guidelines for storing and organizing data in the Wallace lab

All data must be securely stored and backed up, usually to the lab's datastore space. 
Data must also be findable, organized, and described, usually with a `README.txt` or `README.md` file that describes the contents of each directory.


# Guidelines for organising glycerol stock strains in datastore
Information on all Fungal and E.coli strains available in the lab are recorded in an Excel spreadsheet called “ Edward Lab Database” within the “Strains_and_Associated_Info” Folder in datastore: wallace_rna/admin/Inventories. This spreadsheet is divided up into separate sheets for “Yeast” (ie., S.cerevisiae) , “Cryptococcus” and “Bacteria” (ie., E.coli stocks of plasmids). When you make new strains, full details need to be entered into this spreadsheet.

The “Strains_and_Associated_Info” folder also includes additional folders and files:

- **“JA_chimeras_library_yeast_glycerolstock”** – Jamie’s YeastFab database spreadsheet and platemaps of 96-well storage locations together with explanatory “Readme” files as .pdf or .Rmd documents. This folder also contains a subfolder entitled 'JA_chimeras_snapgene_vector_maps' which contains the snapgene vector maps and sequencing trace files verifying the assemblies.

- **“S_cerevisiae_gRNA_plasmids”** -  Snapgene files of gRNA/Cas9 plasmids already existing in the lab - these are linked by name to the relevant entry of the plasmid stock in the “Bacteria” page of “ Edward Lab Database”.

- **“PrimersToTestYeastDelStrains”** – a list of PCR primer sets from the Yeast Deletion Collection that have been used to test deletion strains we already have, together with the expected sizes of their PCR products.

- **“YeastDeletionCollection_Check Primers_PCR_sizes”** - Full list of Primers and Expected PCR product sizes for all of the Yeast Deletion Collection Strains.

- **“YeastDelStrainsfromFoundryin96WellPlate”** – a spreadsheet with the position of a number of yeast deletion strains we got from the Genome Foundry in a 96-well plate.

- **“egf_strains_catalog”** – a list of yeast strains available from the Genome Foundry 

- **“-80 freezer storage locations”** – a spreadsheet showing where communal and personal frozen stocks are kept in the -76oC Freezer – this still needs to be updated to provide space for Rachael . There is also an explanatory “-80 freezer ReadME” file.

- The **“CramerLabDelStrains PCRCheck Primers”** Folder contains snapgene files for CCR4 and POP2(CAF1) genomic sequences together with PCR check primers.
