# Fungal PhD opportunities in Edinburgh 2023

Here in Edinburgh we have an excellent biological sciences community, with many labs working on fundamental biology of fungi and several PhD opportunities available for UK and international students.

There's a project for every fungal-curious student!
Topics including cell cycle, chromatin, RNA biology, signaling, systems biology, synthetic biology, human pathogens, plant pathogens. 
Methods include bioinformatics, biochemistry, structural biology, proteomics, high-throughput sequencing, evolution.
Organisms include *Saccharomyces*, *Candida*, *S. pombe*, *Aspergillus*, Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi.
Research groups include 
[Robin Allshire](https://allshirelab.com),
[Elizabeth Bayne](https://bayne.bio.ed.ac.uk/), 
[Sander Granneman](https://sandergranneman.bio.ed.ac.uk),
[Kevin Hardwick](https://hardwick.bio.ed.ac.uk), 
[Thorunn Helgason](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/thorunn-helgason), 
[Svetlana Makovets](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/sveta-makovets),

Currently we are advertising for October 2023 entry, with deadlines early December 2022:
- [BBSRC/EASTBIO](http://www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/) mostly UK students, some international.
- [Darwin Trust of Edinburgh](https://darwintrust.bio.ed.ac.uk) for international students.
- [Wellcome Integrative Cell Mechanisms](https://www.wcb.ed.ac.uk/iCMPhD) UK & international.


Specific projects can be found on 
[www.findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/university-of-edinburgh/?400b10&Keywords=fungi+or%20fungal%20or%20yeast%20or%20filamentous%20or%20saccharomyces%20or%20pombe).


If you're interested, please contact a project supervisor directly starting by explaining your background and your interest in their work - it's helpful to send a CV too.
There may be opportunities beyond advertised projects, for self-funded or Darwin Trust (international) students.
Or get in touch if you want to know more about the fungal community in Edinburgh and find a project that suits your interests?


## In this group

We are advertising projects looking at how fungi choose which proteins to make when, the machines that control this (RNA-binding proteins) and their evolution.
- [How RNA-binding proteins control fungal growth: an interdisciplinary data-rich approach](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/how-rna-binding-proteins-control-fungal-growth-an-interdisciplinary-data-rich-approach/?p148684), with Atlanta Cook.
- [How do proteins evolve to bind and regulate RNA?](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/how-do-proteins-evolve-to-bind-and-regulate-rna/?p148680) With Sander Granneman.
- [Understanding hyphal growth of filamentous fungi through omics approaches](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/eastbio-understanding-hyphal-growth-of-filamentous-fungi-through-omics-approaches/?p148077), led by Ken Sawin.
- [Investigating cellular strategies for decision-making](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/investigating-cellular-strategies-for-decision-making/?p148688), led by Peter Swain.
