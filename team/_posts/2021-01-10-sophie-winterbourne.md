Sophie is studying a family of pseudoenzymatic double-stranded RNA binding proteins defined by a domain-associated with zinc fingers, using a combination of computational and experimental approaches.
She is jointly supervised by Prof. Atlanta Cook and funded by the [EASTBIO Doctoral Training Partnership](http://www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/). 

She completed a BSc Hons in Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) with her Honours project in the Wallace Lab working with the open-source software package 'riboviz' in 2021. Sophie continued in the Wallace Lab as a Research Assistant in Bioinformatics over the summer before completing an MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Edinburgh.
