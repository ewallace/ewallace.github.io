Dr. Wallace is a Sir Henry Dale Fellow (Group Leader) in the Institute of Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh. His Fellowship is supported by [The Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk) and [The Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org).

Before that, Dr. Wallace held a [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/), also at [The University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), working with [Guido Sanguinetti](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gsanguin/) and [Jean Beggs](http://beggs.bio.ed.ac.uk/).

Dr. Wallace did his postdoctoral work in the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org), initially at Harvard University's [FAS Center for Systems Biology](http://sysbio.harvard.edu/home), in 2010. He moved with the lab to the [University of Chicago] in the Department of [Biochemistry & Molecular Biology], and added experimental capabilities to his computational training. There, he surveyed the heat-triggered movement of proteins into RNA-protein granules, and showed that these proteins are released without detectable degradation as cells recover from stress.

Dr. Wallace received his Ph.D. in [Mathematics](UCMath), also at the [University of Chicago], working with [Jack Cowan](https://cam.uchicago.edu/people/profile/jack-cowan/) on stochastic dynamics of biological networks.
